# NLW eSports

This project was based on the NLW eSports provided by Rocketseat. Here, I added some extra features, like:

- Responsiveness
- Next.js
- External database
- Enable ad publishing

## How to run

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Then, create your `.env` file and add the `DATABASE_URL` setting.

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
